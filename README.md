# Furniture_Classifications

## Overview of the analysis
1. Import the libraries
2. Fetch data
3. Determine the target variable
4. Creation of predictors variables
5. Test and train dataset split
6. Create the machine learning classification model using the train dataset
7. The classification model accuracy_score in Python
8. Prediction
9. Plotting classification data in matplotlib

## Purpose and Analysis

  The purpose of the test is to utilize an image classifier, to classify certain classes of images. Each label is fed into the model and will be recognized. With a sufficient dataset, an image classification model can match new images to its appropriate classes.
